# Telecom Churn Analysis
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore customer churn patterns in a telecom company, highlighting key revenue risks and behavioral segments. The dashboard visualizes tenure, contract type, customer value, and demographics to uncover drivers of churn and help inform retention strategies.

## Key Insights
- **Revenue at Risk**: Visual estimate of monthly churn-driven revenue loss.
- **Churn by Tenure**: Most churn occurs within the first 10 months.
- **Customer Segmentation**: High-value customers are identified by higher total and monthly charges.
- **Contract Impact**: Customers on month-to-month contracts are far more likely to churn.
- **Demographic Patterns**: Customers with no dependents churn more often.
- **Churn Distribution**: Specific price bands have higher churn frequencies.

## Business Use Case
Aimed at a hypothetical telecom provider looking to **identify at-risk customer segments**, reduce revenue loss, and **prioritize retention interventions** based on actionable data.
